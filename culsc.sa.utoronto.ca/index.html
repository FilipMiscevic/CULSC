						<p>From Friday March 6th to Sunday March 8th 2015, we will be hosting the 5th Annual Canadian University Life Sciences Challenge (CULSC)! Undergraduate university students from across Canada are invited to participate in an intense weekend filled with competition, socials, and seminars in breakthrough lectures. Teams of up to four undergraduate students must register in advance for this event, for only $10/participant. This reserves your spot in the competition, gives you access to social events, and includes 2 days of breakfast, and 2 days of lunch.</p>

						<ol>
							<li><span>Neuroscience and Psychology</span></li>
							<li><span>Molecular Biology and Genetics</span></li>
							<li><span>Physiology</span></li>
							<li><span>Anatomy</span></li>
							<li><span>Pathobiology, Immunology, and Microbiology</span></li>
							<li><span>Biochemistry and Pharmacology</span></li>

						<p>Online registration is now available, so start forming your teams! By your powers combined, you can WIN!</p>
						<p>The deadline to register for the 2015 Canadian University Life Sciences Challenge is Friday, March 6th at 5:00 pm. Last-minute teams will be allowed to register in person on the day of the event.</p>

						<h2>Game Rules</h2>
					</div>
					
					<div class="details">
						<h3>General Game Format</h3>
						<p>The pool play will consist of five rounds. Each round will be of increasing difficulty (easy questions in round 1, hardest in round 5). Correct answers will also be weighed based on the difficulty of the round. So, one correct answer in the first round will amount to 100 points while one correct answer in the fifth round will amount to 500 points (linear interpolation for the middle three rounds). The top (nine) teams will proceed to the semifinals based on their total score rankings during the pool play. From there, the top (three) teams will compete in the championship round.</p> 
						<h3>Pool Play Rules</h3>
						<p>During pool play, the indicated team will get to choose which question to answer. If they answer correctly, they get the full value of the points. The other teams in the room will also have an opportunity to write down an answer to the question. Should they get it right, they will receive half of the points normally awarded. Should they get it wrong, they will lose half the points normally awarded.</p>
						<h3>Semifinal Play</h3>
						<p>Here, each team will have an opportunity to write down the answer to the given questions. Should they get it right, the corresponding number of points will be awarded. There is no penalty for incorrect answers.</p>
						<h3>Championship Round</h3>
						<p>The game play for the championship round will assume the format of pool play.</p>
